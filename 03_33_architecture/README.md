# Summary:
This script uses the transformers library to load the GPT-2 language model, apply 8-bit quantization, and tokenize an input text string. The key steps are:

## Import Libraries:

AutoModelForCausalLM: Used to load a pre-trained causal language model like GPT-2.
AutoTokenizer: Used to load the tokenizer for GPT-2.
BitsAndBytesConfig: Configures 8-bit quantization.

## Set Up Quantization:

The BitsAndBytesConfig object is created with the argument load_in_8bit=True, which applies 8-bit quantization to the model during loading. This helps reduce memory usage without losing too much performance.

## Load the Model:

The GPT-2 model ("gpt2") is loaded with the quantization configuration applied. The config argument is used to pass the quantization settings.

## Load the Tokenizer:

The tokenizer for GPT-2 is loaded, which is used to convert text into token IDs and vice versa.

## Tokenize Input Text:

The input text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is tokenized using the tokenizer. The return_tensors="pt" argument ensures the tokens are returned as PyTorch tensors.

## Print Results:

The script prints the size of the input_ids tensor and the tokenized output itself.

# Purpose:

The script demonstrates how to load a pre-trained model (GPT-2), apply 8-bit quantization to save memory, and use the tokenizer to process an input text for further use (e.g., for generation or inference tasks).
